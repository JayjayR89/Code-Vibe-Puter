## ⚠️ Important Note: Some Sites May Not Work

Some websites (like news.ycombinator.com) block embedding in iframes, so they will not load in the Simple Browser. If you see a message like "refused to connect" or a broken page icon, try a different website that allows embedding.

**Example sites you can use:**
- https://example.com
- https://developer.mozilla.org
- https://www.wikipedia.org
